https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/,Woman set to demolish luxury lodge in her garden after it's deemed 'second home',"“It isn’t a second home. If I wanted to go on holiday to my second home why would I want to do it in my back garden?""Sign up for our free weekly newsletter for all the latest on the local property market including dream homes, where to buy and DIY hacksWe have more newslettersA former hairdresser who moved to Wales in order to set up her dream retirement retreat has said she now needs to demolish her ‘second home’ after a neighbour complained.Hazel Cullen, 60, moved to a farm in Builth Wells, Powys, east Wales, with husband Richard and teenage daughter Megan four years ago as part of a mission to build her ‘dream’ cabin lodge.She transformed an originally tired-looking cabin in the farm’s two-acre garden into a luxury getaway lovingly named Woodpecker Lodge which housed holiday makers throughout the year.READ MORE: Join the FREE Manchester Evening News WhatsApp communityBut Hazel claims she has now been left with no choice but to demolish the lodge after a neighbour's complaint triggered a three-year planning issue, Wales Online reports.She says a second homes tax has also 'put the kibosh on it' and now wishes she had never undertaken the transformation project on the Matt's Farm cabin in the first place.Helen explained that a neighbour’s complaint over lights in the lodge alerted Powys County Council. “A valuation officer turned up in March 2020 and we initially were told everything would be okay,” former hairdresser Hazel said. “But then we were given a council tax bill and were told it was because the cabin was a second home.“It isn’t a second home. If I wanted to go on holiday to my second home why would I want to do it in my back garden? We told them it wasn’t a second home, it’s a cabin, but they weren’t having any of it. The council tax on it is going up and up and next year it’s going to be ridiculous. I’ll be losing money on it.”Hazel has spent three years arguing that she should not be paying second home council tax on the cabin. She says the cabin is simply an extension to her home and is even attached to their water and electricity. No-one ever paid council tax on it before she moved to Matt's Farm, she said.Since 2017 local authorities in Wales have been able to charge a premium of up to 100% of the standard rate of council tax on second homes. Under new criteria, councils now have the choice to increase council tax premiums to 300%.By the end of the financial year Hazel believes she will pay up to a 300% premium on her cabin, totalling more than £9,000 annually – more than three times the bills in her 11-room country home. Hazel, originally from Yorkshire, said: ""When we moved here we decided to do it because you could get more for your money here than in Crickhowell. It was all overgrown with trees hiding the cabin – we couldn't even see it.""As soon as I saw it I fell in love with it and knew exactly what I wanted to do. We cleared the garden and cleaned out the cabin and got it all ready before we got locked down and then had this guy at the gate from the Valuation Office Agency saying: 'It's been reported that there has been a light on in the cabin and it's being lived in.' I saw on his laptop that he had all of the information about us from Booking.com and I let him take pictures.""Hazel said that the cabin, which is no bigger than a standard garage, couldn't be considered a second home because there aren't enough facilities in there. The cabin has a bathroom, a bedroom, and a lounge packed into a cosy space which adds to its appeal.""I assured them those staying in the cabin can't prepare food in there and there is no kitchen,"" she said. ""Those staying in there come to the conservatory and I do them breakfast.""The man from the Valuation Office was very nice and said there would be no problems. But the next thing I got a council tax bill from Powys council. I haven't got a problem with the council tax because it's band A and that's fine. But what I've got an issue with is that they call it a second home.""We told the council it's a bedroom extension and it's linked to our water and electricity but they've decided to class it as a second home and have even given it its own address. The premiums are ridiculous. This year they've put the premium on it to 75% which takes the price up to £2,163. Next year it's going to be up to 300% which will be £9,000.""It's busy but it's only open for half of the year and it doesn't merit keeping it open while paying that amount of tax. They've said they won't remove the council tax on it unless it becomes derelict so basically I now have to demolish it.""We love Wales, we love providing tourism in Wales, but this has all made us think: 'Do we want to live over the border instead?' My husband has always lived in Wales and he has said it's got so bad with all of the charges that he would now consider moving to England to do it instead.""Here I could turn every room in this house into bed and breakfast accommodation and they wouldn't charge us a penny extra but I can't have the cabin outside, which was already there when we got here, without being charged this premium. This was my retirement dream but this whole thing has put the kibosh on it.""It would be such a shame [to have to demolish it] because we love it here and we love the area. So many small local businesses are having difficulties and we always recommend local places to go and see.""This year Hazel said the cabin is booked most weekends and has been particularly popular for the Epynt Rally, the Royal Welsh Show, and wool festival Wonderwool Wales. “Even though we're so popular I know next year with that 300% premium I'll be doing it for nothing,” she explained. “We'll struggle this year, let alone next.""A spokesman for Powys County Council, which currently charges a 75% premium., said owners would need to contact the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) directly if they wish to challenge the classification of their property.A Welsh Government spokeswoman said 'it is for each local authority to decide whether to apply council tax premiums to the second homes and long-term empty properties in their area'. The spokeswoman confirmed that 'holiday lets captured by one of the exceptions should not be charged a premium'.Read next:-"

Below are a number of changes coming this month.Young driversIn a bid to boost road safety, newly-licenced drivers under the age of 25 could be prevented from carrying passengers in the same age limit.The proposals would suggest the introduction of a ‘graduated driving licence’ which would restrict newly-passed motorists from having a full licence initially.Many experts believe a form of probationary period for younger drivers could benefit all road users and reduce the risks of accidents. Further considerations for the plans will be discussed by Transport Minister Richard Holden at a road safety meeting on May 16.Seb Goldin, CEO of RED Driver Training, said: ""We know that people of all ages rely on the freedom that driving provides, and graduated driving licencing risks placing restrictions on this.""However, data shows that in countries where graduated driving licencing is in effect, it is being received well and, in an environment where incidents on our roads are commonplace, taking steps to reduce the risks of death and serious injuries is a protocol we support.""Road safety remains our ultimate concern, and this probationary period for drivers who are more likely to be involved in an incident allows us to prioritise this even further.”ZEV mandateA Zero Emission Vehicle mandate currently in the midst of a consultation phase looks to promote the use of electric vehicles and ensure manufacturers are meeting targets to ensure there are enough vehicles on the market in time for the 2030 petrol and diesel new car ban.A consultation was launched in March to assess how the ZEV mandate will work, including how it will affect businesses and whether any exemptions are necessary.The consultation on the final design of the UK’s ZEV mandate and CO2 emissions regulation will close at 11.45pm on May 24.New council powersAccording to a Freedom of Information request, 12 councils have been handed new traffic powers to fine drivers for offences that were previously only issued by the police.In May, Surrey Council will begin monitoring yellow box junctions and potentially issuing fines of up to £70. Reading and Hampshire Councils will also receive powers in “Spring 2023”.Derby City, Buckinghamshire and Norfolk councils have also been granted powers, but it isn’t yet known which areas they’ll be monitoring.Fuel tanker consultationThe Government is currently consulting on the viability of allowing fuel tankers to carry more fuel than the existing 44-tonne weight limit.It was launched in response to the fuel crisis experienced in 2022 by drivers up and down the country when forecourts were hit with massive disruptions to fuel supplies.The consultation will end on May 17, with the Department for Transport accepting feedback until 11.45pm.READ NEXT:Man admits owning pack of dangerously out of control dogs which attacked six-year-old girlInside Manchester Airport's new Terminal 2Cops 'cut off the head of the snake' as warehouse bustedTwo men arrested after police unearth huge suspected cannabis farmGMP failure to disclose evidence led to man spending 17 years in jail, court told"

Before the election, the Tories were the largest party in the borough and had run the council as a minority administration but they now sit in second place behind Labour, who gained seven seats.READ MORE: Join the FREE Manchester Evening News WhatsApp communityAppearing on Sophy Ridge On Sunday, the Culture Secretary said that the disruption caused by the pandemic and Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine was having a toll on voters.“If we could look at the context for the whole local election, we’ve been in power for a long time,” Ms Frazer told Sky News.“We’ve just had a pandemic which has disrupted many people’s lives and has had consequences for the economy, as has the war in Ukraine, which is going on.”Pressed on whether she understood the scale of her party’s losses, she said: “Totally, it’s really important that we listen to people. I know people are frustrated and angry.”Explaining how she recognised the results were “not good”, she added: “I totally understand that we need to do better and I think we are going to deliver.”Despite the results, Ms Frazer claimed that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was starting to regain the public’s trust by delivering his five priorities, including curbing inflation, in a “quiet way”.“I totally recognise we’ve had a really difficult few years,” she explained. “I do think that the Prime Minister, who’s now been in office for six months, is getting the country back on track and is delivering. I think we’re starting to gain the trust of the British public.”Pressed on whether the Tories needed to offer more than Mr Sunak’s promises from January, she told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg On Sunday programme: “We absolutely need to reflect. I think Rishi’s only been the Prime Minister for six months.”Kuenssberg said: “It’s not five minutes, it’s six months.”“It’s not five minutes but these are huge challenges,” Ms Frazer replied.Some Tories blamed the electoral hammering on the lack of tax cuts. Former minister Sir John Redwood tweeted: “Last Thursday many Conservative voters went on strike. They do not want to vote for higher taxes, anti enterprise policies and a failure to take back control of our borders.”Ms Frazer insisted the Government was doing those things, saying: “The biggest tax cut we can make is a cut in inflation”.Meanwhile, Labour was celebrating “pretty encouraging” local election results, which saw Sir Keir Starmer’s party gain 635 seats and take control of another 22 local authorities.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told Ridge: “I think for the next general election Labour feels confident but not complacent.”READ NEXT:I made the 68p solution declared 'the best weed killer ever' and it worked wondersAfter a tough year with soaring bills, not everyone was happy about the Coronation in Manchester yesterdayThe Coronation Big Lunch - How local communities are celebrating the King's CoronationTwo arrested after man seriously injured during 'disorder' at block of flats""I finally tried 'Greater Manchester's best burger'.

With Meghan Markle not attending, Harry walked in alone and was sat down next to Eugenie's husband Jack Brooskbank.According to a lip reader, Harry joked about his busy day and told Jack he would be leaving at ""about quarter to four"", to which Jack replied: ""Oh really, when?""Harry was also believed to have said ""that's funny"" to Brooksbank while smiling as they waited for Charles to arrive at Westminster Abbey.While walking in, Harry gave courteous greetings to some of the other guests, saying ""hello"", ""morning"" and ""nice to see you"" to various people. Our lip reader has also claimed he said ""look at that"" while noticing the grandeur of the occasion and also said ""delightful"".Meanwhile during the ceremony, as the congregation paid homage to the new monarch, Harry was seen, along with the other royals around him, speaking the words: ""God save King Charles. Long live King Charles. May the King live forever.""It was one of the most important days of his life, which saw him crowned in a historic spectacle at Westminster Abbey. So it's no surprise that King Charles wanted all aspects of his Coronation day to run like clockwork.However, when arriving in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach at Westminster Abbey, royal fans wondered why he appeared agitated. He could be seen talking to Queen Camilla in what appeared to be an irritated manner as they waited to exit the carriage.And a lip reader say it appears he was bemoaning keeping to the day's timetable. The lip reader claims he uttered to his wife: ""We can never be on time, there's always something...""Other than the King and Queen, one of the other stars of the show was Prince Louis who delighted everyone with his adorable antics.Before his appearance on the balcony, he joined his parents, Prince George and Princess Charlotte in a carriage to join the procession back to Buckingham Palace.As he left the ceremony with his family to appear for the balcony, Louis could be seen cheering for his grandfather from the royal carriage, as he exclaimed: 'Yaaaay king. Yaaaay king,' lip reading expert Jacqui Press told Femail.He then appeared on the balcony, where he enthusiastically cheered at the flypast and tried to distract his brother George.Meanwhile, when he moved to the balcony, it appears that Louis was very inquisitive and was keen to ask lots of questions. Moments before the flypast began, Louis was seen adorably banging his fists on the balcony, impatiently waiting for it to start amid the rainy weather.As the planes and helicopters started to soar in the sky, little Louis squinted and appeared to ask his older sister Charlotte: ""What's those?"" while she smiled.A few moments later, he was seen trying to distract his big brother by yelling at him across William. Our lip reader believes Louis was saying: ""See as far as that?"", to which George grinned and replied: ""I know!""Elswhere, in another balcony moment, Sophie, the new Duchess of Edinburgh, appeared to voice her disappointment about the youngster - specifically his outfit.It came when the royals first came out onto the balcony following the historic service at Westminster Abbey.For the occasion, Louis wore a very smart outfit made by Dege and Skinner consisting of a Hainsworth Garter Blue Doeskin Tunic with specially designed lacework embellishment to the collar, cuffs and fronts.But instead of wearing his trademark shorts, Louis wore long black trousers with smart black shoes.And according to lip reader Elisabeth Taunton, as Kate ushered Louis and Princess Charlotte along the balcony, Sophie mused: ""It's a pity Louis didn't wear his shorts.""This then seemed to have prompted Prince William to offer up why Louis was in long trousers, who apparently said: ""Oh, he didn’t want to wear his shorts"" while a smiling and nodding Kate added: ""Yeah.""READ NEXT:I made the 68p solution declared 'the best weed killer ever' and it worked wondersAfter a tough year with soaring bills, not everyone was happy about the Coronation in Manchester yesterdayThe Coronation Big Lunch - How local communities are celebrating the King's CoronationTwo arrested after man seriously injured during 'disorder' at block of flats""I finally tried 'Greater Manchester's best burger'.

The family made the decision after Ismail Hachem had been struck by a bullet in crossfire while serving in the army during conflict. Mr Hachem travelled with his wife and three children more than 5,000km to the UK. He hoped that the country would provide peace and stability for his young family. This all changed in May 2019 when his oldest daughter, Aya, was gunned down in a bitter feud between rival car tyre firms in Blackburn. She was only 19 years old when she was shot, LancsLive reports. READ MORE: Two arrested after man seriously injured during 'disorder' at block of flats The Hachem family settled in Blackburn after travelling around the UK as refugees. It was a place the Hachem family felt safe, far away from the bloodshed of their homeland.Soon Aya and her siblings settled into education and began working towards a brighter future, and the family welcomed another child. The oldest daughter of the family, Aya rarely spoke of the trauma she had endured in Lebanon, but as a bright student who was awarded Student of the Year at Blackburn Central High School in 2016, she hoped to use her talents to support victims and the persecuted.She began studying law at Salford University aged 18, hoping to specialise in international law. Her dad told her she would be prime minister one day - a dream he and Aya believed would come true.""Aya was our shining star and always made us smile"", said Ismail. The young student was appointed as the youngest ever trustee of the Children's Society and hoped to make the world a better place. She was also heavily involved in Blackburn's asylum seeking community.However, on May 17, as she joined Muslims across the world in marking Ramadan, she was murdered in cold blood as she walked to a local shop to buy food to break the fast. Her mother, Samar, had asked her to go to LIdl to buy lettuce - a simple, everyday task which cost Aya her life.A bullet, fired from a Toyota Avensis, struck Aya as she walked down King Street, passing through her body before becoming embedded in a telegraph pole. She fell to the ground and died almost instantly.In a victim impact statement, Aya's mum spoke of the distress she feels at asking Aya to run an errand for her that day. She said: ""On that day I had sent her to get groceries during Ramadan, how can I live with that?“How can I continue with life, a life full of emptiness. They have taken my soul and crushed it into pieces.”On Friday May 5, 2020, Lewis Junior Otway became the eighth person to be jailed for life for his role in Aya's murder, and the botched plot to kill car wash owner Pashah Khan.Her family said: “We thank God for the justice that has been served today.""To our dear beautiful angel in heaven, we know you are in a better and more beautiful place. God chose you from amongst many and blessed you with martyrdom.""We are so proud of you and we miss you so much – our lives are difficult without you. This is Gods decree and praise be to God for this. You will remain in our hearts forever.""You loved life and despite all the struggles and barriers that we faced in this country it did not stop you contributing to your community and Charities including the Children’s Society and fundraising at Salford University where you were studying to become a barrister.""God chose you as an Angel in his heaven.

https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/,The awkward moments you may have missed from the King’s Coronation,"From Katy Perry trying to find her seat to fans spotting the 'Grim Reaper', there were lots of bizarre moments during the coronationSign up for our daily newsletter to get the day's biggest stories sent direct to your inboxWe have more newslettersWith the eyes of the world on Westminster Abbey yesterday for the King’s Coronation, everything had to be meticulously planned. But despite months of preparation and a mostly-smooth service, there were a few mishaps along the way. King Charles III and his wife Queen Camilla were crowned during the two-hour service, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury. While the ancient ceremony unfolded, there were some key figures and moments which stole the show and caught viewers’ attention, the Mirror reports. From Katy Perry wandering around trying to find her seat, to Princess Anne blocking Prince Harry’s view, there were certainly a few awkward moments which will go down in history. We take a look at some of the strangest moments below. READ MORE: Prince Harry catches British Airways flight to USA HOURS after King Charles III's Coronation US pop singer Katy Perry was among the celebrity guests attending the ceremony. She is set to perform in the Coronation Concert on Sunday evening. But Katy, dressed in a striking baby pink number, left fans in stitches for the wrong reasons at the ceremony on Saturday.On her way into Westminster Abbey, she almost fell to the floor as the heel on her white court shoes almost gave way. And then once inside the abbey, walking alongside British Vogue editor Edward Enninful, the California Gurls star struggled to find her seat among the crowd.Puzzled Katy sought help from guests already seated as she roamed the pews asking which was her spot. She later broke her silence a few hours later, tweeting: ""Don't worry guys I found my seat"".One member of the royal family didn’t receive a warm welcome from crowds ahead of the ceremony. The King's disgraced brother Prince Andrew was booed as he was driven past royalists down The Mall.The Duke of York faced the wrath of some onlookers who vocalised their distaste for him from the grandstand in front of Buckingham Palace. Although he did attend the service, there was no special role for the Prince.Prince Harry attended the coronation ceremony alone as his wife Meghan Markle stayed at home in California to look after their children and celebrate Archie’s birthday. But despite travelling all that way for a seat at the big event, Harry may have had a better view at home as the Princess Royal’s hat ended up obstructing his view. The Duke of Sussex sat in the third row, alongside Princess Eugenie's husband Jack Brooksbank and Princess Alexandra - the cousin of the late Queen who hasn't had a working royal engagement in a decade. Once the ceremony commenced, viewers began to notice that poor Harry's face was being blocked by the red feathers, with some cheeky commentators audaciously suggesting it may have been done on purpose.Although his view wasn’t great, Prince Harry reportedly performed a display of ""cocky bravado"" as he arrived at the ceremony, according to a body language expert. The estranged Prince used his controversial appearance to signal to the world that he was ""happy to be back"" on UK soil after months of attacks on the royal family amid escaping to the US for a new life with Meghan.Body language expert Judi James told The Mirror that viewers witnessed ""an incredible return of the joker prince"" as a grinning Harry arrived alongside royal cousins Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.Several viewers reported seeing a potentially unwelcome guest at Westminster Abbey - a ‘Grim Reaper’. The spooky figure, donning the mythological character's iconic dark robes whilst carrying an item resembling a scythe, was filmed walking by the doors of the abbey.Creeped-out royal fans immediately took to Twitter to share screen grabs of the dark silhouette.King Charles had another awkward mishap with a fountain pen once again after last year's fiasco in Belfast. When it came to singing the oath in the abbey, it seemed the pen wasn't working as intended amid the important declaration.Charles could be seen grimacing as he placed the lid back on top of the stationery item. The monarch is known to carry his own pen for when he is frequently asked to sign visitors' books during royal visits, but it seems the item has been letting him down lately.While Camilla’s family proudly looked on as she was anointed following Charles, her crown appeared to not be the best fit. The new Queen was filmed using her index finger to adjust her hair underneath the crown at least five times.She then raised her hand and appeared to give the Archbishop of Canterbury some verbal assistance. It came after the Archbishop was forced to spend several seconds adjusting the crown on the King's head.Naturally Prince Louis stole the show at certain points during the ceremony. The five-year-old royal distracted viewers first by yawning and fidgeting, before accidentally singing 'God Save The Queen' for the National Anthem when the service came to an end.There was also confusion when the young prince appeared to go missing from the ceremony and wasn't seen next to his parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales. He did process into the abbey with his family - but due to still being young, he was ""retired"" during the service due to his tender age.More than 4,000 ceremonial troops took part in the procession escorting the new King and Queen back to Buckingham Palace in the historic Gold State Coach. However unfortunately just moments before the procession kicked off, a Royal Navy officer dramatically fainted.A small number of military members rushed to assist their colleague who was quickly put onto a stretcher and given medical assistance.For more of today's top stories, click here.

https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/,Married dad-of-four groomed girls online and plied them with booze before raping teen under Blackpool pier,"Cristian Piscurianu lied about his age and messaged on social media, a court heardA dad-of-four groomed three teenage girls online and plied them with booze before raping one of them under a pier in Blackpool. A court heard how married Cristian Piscurianu had told the teenagers he was 18 years old when they were aged 13 and 15 and 'not worldly wise'.He had been in the UK for 'a matter of weeks' when he first began grooming the girls, who had been hanging around a supermarket. The 26-year-old, who was aged 22 at the time, tried to persuade the girls to perform oral sex on him in March 2019.Preston Crown Court heard that two of the girls were able to say no, but Piscurianu took the other to the beach and forced himself on her. It left Piscurianu's victim drinking and smoking cannabis to try and forget what had happened, Lancs Live reports.READ MORE: Join the FREE Manchester Evening News WhatsApp communityPiscurianu has now been sentenced to 16 years and three months in jail after being found guilty of rape and two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Following the incident, Piscurianu denied the offences and claimed DNA evidence found on the girl's jeans was spittle. He continued to deny he had raped the girl and groomed her two friends throughout a trial - but was convicted by the jury. Throughout the proceedings, the defendant was supported by his wife and members of his family who sat in the public gallery. The court heard the defendant 'acted with others' to groom the teenagers. ""These girls were clearly unsophisticated and not worldly wise,"" Judge Lloyd said. ""From their profile pictures they were clearly children."" The judge said the girls were unfamiliar with simple sexual terms.""They were no doubt flattered by the attention you and your friends gave them. You were on social media with one of them, prior to sexual offending against her, asking for sexy pictures, and you rang her asking to meet in the days before the offence.""You offered the girls cigarettes and alcohol and gave one of them a bracelet. It was inevitable they would be flattered by the attention they were getting outside that shop from you and your friends.""They initially thought it was a giggle to be in your company but they weren't prepared for what you wanted from them. Two of them were able to say no and not be forced into anything. The other was not so lucky.""This was grooming behaviour. You lied about your age and there was a significant disparity. In my mind, a nine or seven year disparity is significant when you are a sexually experienced, married man with children, and your victims themselves are children.""One of the girls said since she was raped she felt scared and upset and struggled to cope with school. Following the attack she was drinking and smoking cannabis regularly to try and forget about what had happened.Four years later she has a supportive partner but still feels uncomfortable around men she doesn't know, she said. Another of Piscurianu's victims said she feels anxious in crowds and does not go out alone, while the third said she is now petrified of Romanian men. She said she has seen members of her abuser's family while travelling on public transport and feels anxious, sometimes causing her to miss her stop. She also said her relationships with men have been affected.Judge Lloyd said Pisturianu, of Jameson Street, Blackpool, poses a danger of serious harm and classed him as a dangerous offender. She sentenced him to three years concurrently for each offence of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, with a further 10 years and three months for rape. She also imposed a three year extended licence period.Get the latest headlines hereREAD NEXT:""I've just stabbed him sir..."" - Teen who brought knife into school stabbed fellow student in classroom revenge attackWhat's happening on the posh city centre street with so many 'to let signs'""I finally tried 'Greater Manchester's best burger'.

Harry caught a British Airways flight to Los Angeles International Airport.He arrived at around 7.30pm local time (3.30am UK) before being reunited with Archie, who turned four on Saturday (May 6). Archie had spent the day with Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, at the family's US home while the Coronation took place in London.British Airways flight attendants confirmed Harry had been on the flight to the PA news agency.

He was seated in the third row for the crowning of Charles and the duke’s stepmother the Queen in Westminster Abbey, and was placed two rows behind his brother the Prince of Wales.Harry chatted to his cousin Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi as he entered the church on Saturday in the drizzling UK rain. He also nodded and smiled to guests as he processed behind them, walking down the nave of the abbey alone.It is understood the duke wore what he was asked to wear, which consisted of a dark morning suit and tie, his Afghanistan and Jubilee medals pinned to his suit jacket, and a Royal Victorian Order star and neck decoration. During the service, as the congregation paid homage to the King, Harry was seen, along with the other royals around him, speaking the words: “God save King Charles. ""Long live King Charles. May the King live forever.”His abrupt return to the US meant he did not appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the finale of the day, with the Palace confirming earlier that he had no formal role at the event. Also absent from the balcony was the Duke of York, who has stepped away from public life after a controversial Newsnight interview in November 2019 and the furore over his friendship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.Get the latest headlines hereREAD NEXT:""I've just stabbed him sir..."" - Teen who brought knife into school stabbed fellow student in classroom revenge attackWhat's happening on the posh city centre street with so many 'to let signs'""I finally tried 'Greater Manchester's best burger'.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk,"Police made tough calls on Coronation arrests, says minister","The police had to make ""tough choices"" while handling protests during the Coronation, a minister has said, following criticism over arrests. Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer told BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the police were right to factor in the scale and global-nature of the event. MPs, human rights groups and a former chief constable have criticised the police's tactics.Police said on Sunday that 64 people were arrested during the Coronation.The Metropolitan Police had previously said 52 arrests were made on Saturday. In its latest update, it said four people had been charged, while another person arrested remains in custody for non-payment of fines. Fifty-seven people have been released on bail while two others will face no further police action.Among those held on Saturday was the head of the anti-monarchy group Republic, Graham Smith. He was released after 16 hours in custody and said there was ""no longer a right to peaceful protest in the UK"".Other concerns have been raised over reports three volunteers with a Westminster-based women's safety programme had been arrested while handing out rape alarms.The Met said it received intelligence protesters were planning to use rape alarms to disrupt coronation proceedings. Ms Frazer said the right to protest was ""really important"" and people should be heard but there had been a recent change in protesters' tactics.Protesters have been stopping people going about their day-to-day lives, she said, and there was a need to redress that balance.Officers would have made operational decisions on a case-by-case basis, she said, taking into account the scale of the Coronation celebrations. ""We were on the global stage, there were 200 foreign dignitaries in the UK, in London at an event, millions of people watching and hundreds of thousands of people at the scene,"" she added.Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC he was reassured the Met were aware of a gap in public confidence over policing and the force was ""explaining and justifying"" why they made some of the arrests.He said Labour would ""wait and see"" whether the force got the balance right, adding ""accountability"" over policing decisions was important.Mr Streeting said if they did not get it right, it was important to ""hold your hands up"".Metropolitan Police Commander Karen Findlay defended her officers' response, saying they had a duty to intervene ""when protest becomes criminal and may cause serious disruption"".She added the Coronation was a ""once-in-a-generation event"" which was a key consideration in their assessment.Hundreds of protesters gathered in the rain in central London on Saturday, with chants including ""down with the Crown"", ""don't talk to the police"" and ""get a real job"".But Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said some of the arrests ""raise questions"" over the Met's actions, adding he has ""sought urgent clarity"" whilst investigations are ongoing. Other protests were organised in Cardiff, Glasgow and Edinburgh. No arrests were reported outside London.While campaigners insisted their protests were peaceful, the police said they had intelligence that groups were ""determined to disrupt"" the occasion.Leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey said he was not sure about the exact circumstances of the arrest, and called for more detail from the police. Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, he criticised the government for ""passing legislation to clamp down on protest that breached British traditions of civil liberties"".Several Labour MPs have also been critical of the Met's response. Senior backbencher Sir Chris Bryant said on Twitter that ""freedom of speech is the silver thread that runs through a parliamentary constitutional monarchy"".In a statement on Sunday, Republic chief Mr Smith said the arrests had ""destroyed whatever trust might have existed between peaceful protesters and the Metropolitan police"".""What is the point in being open and candid with the police, working with their liaison officers and meeting senior commanders, if all their promises and undertakings turn out to be a lie?""Mr Smith was arrested early on Saturday - before the Coronation began - at a protest in Trafalgar Square.Watch: Anti-monarchy protester Matt Turnbull arrested near Trafalgar SquareThe Met said it had confiscated ""lock-on devices"" which protesters can use to secure themselves to things like railings. It has now become illegal to prepare to lock-on following changes to the law passed this week.But Matt Turnbull, another member of Republic who was arrested, said the straps were being used to hold the placards and had been ""misconstrued"" as lock-on devices. A former police chief has said she is ""very disappointed"" by the arrest of protesters and strongly criticised the new powers. Sue Sim, a former chief constable with Northumbria Police and a specialist in public order policing, said she was ""very disappointed"" by the arrest of protesters and called the new powers ""draconian"".""I think when you're talking about terrorism, where people's lives are at risk that's a very different thing. But where you are talking about peaceful protest the whole thing for me is, what type of society do we want? We do not want a totalitarian police state,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend. Concerns about the police's approach were also raised by Westminster City Council over reports that volunteers with its Night Star women's safety programme had been detained and questioned after being stopped by officers while handing out rape alarms.Councillor Aicha Less said the authority was working with the Met to establish what happened and was in touch with volunteers to make sure they were being supported.The Met said it had received intelligence about plans to use rape alarms to disrupt the Coronation procession by scaring military horses, causing ""significant risk to the safety of the public and the riders"".The force said three people were arrested in the Soho area of London over suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance. One man was also further arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods. All three have since been released.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said the force were ""aware of and understand there is public concern over these arrests"" and added the matter was still under investigation.Dozens of protesters arrested during CoronationCharles and Camilla crowned in historic CoronationCoronation protests allowed, security minister saysRoyalists and republicans mark the CoronationArrested heckler vows to protest at CoronationPolice take to rooftops and manholes for funeral securityPa, we are all so proud of you, says WilliamCoronation concert wows King and crowd.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk,King Charles III's Coronation watched by more than 18 million viewers,"The King's Coronation was watched by an average of 18 million viewers in the UK, overnight figures have shown. The ceremony, which saw the King and Queen Camilla crowned, was broadcast simultaneously across a range of channels between 11:00 and 13:00 BST. Viewing peaked at 20.4 million as the King was crowned just after midday, audience measurement group Barb said. The figures are smaller than when an average of 26.5 million viewers tuned in for Queen Elizabeth II's funeral. An average of 18.8 million people tuned into watch the Coronation across 11 channels and services, including BBC One, Two, ITV and Sky News. On BBC One, a peak of 13.4 million viewers tuned in to the broadcast led by Huw Edwards and the channel had an average audience of 11.9 million, the BBC said.ITV said an average of 3.3 million viewers watched the ceremony on ITV1 between 10:45 and 13:00.Sky News had an average of 568,000 viewers during its broadcast of the Coronation service, while GB News had an average of 176,000 and Talk TV had an average of 14,000 viewers. Channel 4 opted to show film Johnny English Strikes Again instead of the Coronation with an average of 138,000 people preferring to the watch Rowan Atkinson film. Meanwhile, on Channel 5 children were entertained with The Adventures of Paddington Bear and SpongeBob SquarePants. Millions of people are thought to have watched the Queen's coronation on television in 1953 - but there are no reliable figures, making it difficult to measure against this year's ceremony. Based on surveys carried out by the BBC at the time, it is estimated that more than 20 million adults in the UK watched it. The funeral service for the King's ex-wife Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 was seen by 31 million on BBC and ITV - making it the highest TV audience on record.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk,Celebrations continue across Scotland after Coronation parade,"Parties are being held across Scotland to mark the Coronation following a military parade in honour of the new King and Queen.King Charles III and Queen Camilla were crowned in Westminster Abbey on Saturday.On Sunday about 1,500 people in the Aberdeenshire village of Ballater held a Big Lunch featuring a pipe band on the village's Church Green.It has boasted a close royal connection since Queen Victoria was on the throne. Ballater was also one of the first places King Charles visited after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at nearby Balmoral last September.David Corbyn, who helped organise the event, said: ""We feel an affinity with the royal family, we have a strong respect for them and they have for us, so this is a celebration of everything they've achieved and what they are now about to as King and Queen.""It's a great opportunity for us to come together and show our appreciation.""Celebrations continue after Coronation paradeEarlier hundreds of military personnel took part in a march through Glasgow to mark the event.The city's Lord Lieutenant Jacqueline McLaren congratulated King Charles and Queen Camilla during the ceremony.The George Square celebration featured a guard of honour inspection, three cheers for the King and Queen, and the national anthem.In her speech, the Lord Lieutenant, who attended the Coronation at Westminster Abbey on behalf of the city, told the crowd: ""I would like to thank you all for attending today to mark this historic occasion.""I was honoured, as the city's representative of Their Majesties, to accept their invitation to witness the historic ceremony at Westminster Abbey - a memorable and once-in-a-lifetime event.""On behalf of the city on this day, which marks the first full day of our new King's reign, I wish the royal couple longevity, happiness and wisdom.""The Lord Lieutenant said she met the King last year at the opening of the refurbished Burrell Collection and hoped to welcome the royal couple back to Glasgow ""very soon"".She then took the salute as the parade of military servicemen and women, cadets and veterans marched past the City Chambers.Afterwards they paraded through the city to Glasgow Cathedral for a thanksgiving service.In Edinburgh, the annual interfaith event was moved to coincide with the Coronation weekend. The annual peace walk welcomed those of any or no faith to celebrate diversity and respect differing views on the monarchy.Nasim Azad, co-convenor of Edinburgh Interfaith Association, said the walk helped to forge connections between people of different faiths.She added: ""Every year so many people come along and every year it's growing.""The walk presents a safe space for people to come together and get to know each other."" People met at Leith's Gurdwara to mark the Vaisakhi spring festival before joining the walk.Wege Singh, the general secretary of the Leith Gurdwara, says: ""We're very much in support of the Royal Family and all the work they're doing, especially King Charles. ""He's shown that he's very, very in touch with the community so we're looking forward to his reign.""Public screenings of the Coronation were held in Glasgow Cathedral and at the Ross Bandstand in Edinburgh's Princes Street Gardens.Another community lunch event was held in the school hall on Westray in the Orkney Islands on Sunday to bring the small community of less than 600 people together.Locals pitched in to make sandwiches and bake cakes for the Big Lunch held in the island's school hall.Davy, 13, said: ""The food's really good and there's a lot of people here from the island. The Coronation was good too.""And more than 300 people turned out for a similar celebration in Gartocharn, West Dunbartonshire, which featured bouncy castles and ice-cream.Organiser James MacRae, 82, said: ""These events are important because they pull a community together.""I feel on an occasion like a coronation, particularly a once in 70-year coronation, that we must have an event.""More than 200 Coronation Big Lunch events have been registered across Scotland over Coronation weekend.The Queen has been Patron of The Big Lunch initiative since 2013 and the events encourage neighbours and communities to meet and share food.Locals in Broughton in the Scottish Borders celebrated the occasion with food, a choir and a band.Jennifer McBeth owns the community shop and organised the Broughton Big Coronation Lunch.She said: ""We've got a fantastic turnout today. We're here for the Coronation lunch and we're about to play the national anthem and toast to the King. ""But we also want to bring the village together. This is another chance to meet new people as people come and go from the village.""Gun salutes were fired at Edinburgh and Stirling Castles to mark the moment the King was crowned.At the ceremony in Westminster Abbey, the Scottish government was represented by First Minister Humza Yousaf, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bail KC and the Permanent Secretary John-Paul Marks.Other dignitaries included Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, Scottish Parliament Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone, ex-prime minister Gordon Brown and former lord advocate Dame Elish Angiolini KC.Several hundred other Scots also made the trip to London to be closer to the main event, with some camping for several days in dreary weather.King Charles' former school Gordonstoun held its own Coronation for younger pupils to learn more about the ceremony on Friday. And on the day of the Coronation, older students volunteered to take part in a run and swim.The event was based on a daily timetable from the 1960s, which was recently discovered in the school archive.Meanwhile, thousands also attended an independence march and rally in Glasgow, which was addressed by former first minister Alex Salmond.And in Edinburgh about 500 people gathered on Calton Hill for an anti-monarchy rally organised by Our Republic.Crowds build ahead of star-studded Coronation concertScotland celebrates the Coronation of King CharlesIn Pictures: Scots mark the King's CoronationPa, we are all so proud of you, says WilliamCoronation concert wows King and crowd.
